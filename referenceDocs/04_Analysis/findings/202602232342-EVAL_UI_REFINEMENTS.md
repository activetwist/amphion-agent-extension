# EVALUATE: Onboarding Webview UX Refinements

**Phase: 1 (Research & Scoping)**
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Focus:** Enhancing the approachability and clarity of the Onboarding UI.

## 1. Research & Analysis
- **The Issue:** The Onboarding WebUI currently uses language that is overly academic ("Manual Strategy Definition", "Core Value Proposition") or corporate ("Success Metric"). Furthermore, the default port `4000` is conventionally associated with Node.js, which could cause confusion now that the backend is exclusively Python.
- **The Inspiration:** The user provided two helper context documents (`UX Language Remediation for Approachability.md` and `Empowering Micro-Contract Development.md`) containing explicit recommendations for micro-copy adjustments that frame the project setup as an empowering blueprint rather than a rigid "strategy" or compliance task.

## 2. Gap Analysis
- `mcd-starter-kit-dev/extension/src/onboardingWebview.ts` contains the hardcoded string labels and default values that need to be updated.

## 3. Scoping Boundaries
**In-Scope:**
- Changing the default `initPort` value from `4000` to `8765` (the standard Python Command Deck port).
- Adding a new header block above the Port / Initial Version fields:
  - Heading: "Command Deck Setup"
  - Content: "We are setting up your Command Deck — with a Kanban, Dashboard, and Mermaid charts viewer, as well as an overview of Micro-Contract Development."
- Updating the labels and placeholders in the "Manual Strategy Definition" view according to the "UX Language Remediation" doc:
  - "Manual Strategy Definition" -> "Project Blueprint"
  - "Target Users" -> "Who is this for?" (Placeholder: *e.g., Freelance designers using AI for layout ideas*)
  - "Problem Statement" -> "What are you solving?" (Placeholder: *e.g., It takes too long to format resumes manually*)
  - "Core Value Proposition" -> "The Big Idea" (Placeholder: *e.g., A one-click tool that turns LinkedIn profiles into PDFs*)
  - "Hard Non-Goals" -> "Out of Scope" (Placeholder: *e.g., No mobile app; No custom fonts in v1*)
  - "Success Metric" -> "Definition of 'Done'" (Placeholder: *e.g., A user can export a finished resume in 60 seconds*)
- Implementing "Progressive Disclosure" hints (tooltips/small notes) for these fields, e.g., describing "The Big Idea" as "Describe the one main benefit your project provides."
- Updating the success screen copy according to the "Empowering MCD" doc:
  - "Strategy Documents Completed!" -> "System Architecture Locked!"
  - "...ready for execution." -> "...ready for Micro-Contracting."
  - "Launch the Command Deck to view your Kanban board and govern your Micro-Contracts." -> "Open the Command Deck to partition your work into Micro-Contracts and begin execution."
- Bumping the extension version to `1.26.2` to deploy this UI refinement.

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Any modifications to the data payload structure sent to the backend; this is strictly a cosmetic/label change in HTML.
- Modifying the markdown templates generated by the wizard (the internal variables `targetUsers`, `problemStatement` etc. will remain functionally identical to avoid pipeline breakage).

## 4. Primitive Review
- N/A. No new architecture primitives needed.
