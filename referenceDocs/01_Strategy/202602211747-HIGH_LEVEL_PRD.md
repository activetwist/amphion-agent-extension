# High-Level PRD — AmphionAgent

Codename: `BlackClaw`
Version: `v0.01a`
Date: `202602211747`

---

## Background

**Target Users**: Solo operators and AI-assisted developers who build software using Agentic IDEs (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Codex) and need a deterministic, contract-governed development framework to eliminate scope drift, maintain decision traceability, and produce audit-ready project histories.

**Problem**: AI coding agents generate code at extraordinary speed, but without a governance layer, that speed produces fragile, undocumented, and ungovernable software. Scope drifts silently. Decisions are improvised rather than authorized. Git histories become opaque. When something breaks, there is no contract to trace the change back to and no checkpoint to safely roll back to.

## Version v0.01a Feature Set

- **MCD Project Scaffold** — A single VS Code command (`MCD: Initialize New Project`) initializes a complete, governance-ready workspace via a 5-prompt wizard (Project Name, Server Language, Codename, Initial Version, Command Deck Port). Works on both empty folders and existing projects.
- **GUARDRAILS.md Generation** — Auto-generated governance guardrails document, dynamically interpolated with project name and codename, establishing the non-negotiable rules for every MCD-governed project.
- **MCD_PLAYBOOK.md** — Static, embedded copy of the complete MCD operating manual, available from every project scaffold and rendered inside the Command Deck.
- **Charter / PRD Wizard** — Post-scaffold opt-in wizard that collects 6 data points (Target Users, Problem Statement, Core Value, Non-Goals, Key Features, Success Metric) and writes timestamped `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` and `HIGH_LEVEL_PRD.md` stubs or fully populated documents.
- **Source Documents Path (v1.3)** — Before the manual wizard, the operator may import existing background documents into `helperContext/`. The extension writes stub Charter/PRD files with `[AI_DERIVE]` markers pointing to the imported sources so an in-workspace AI agent can complete them.
- **Command Deck — Kanban Board** — A fully local, zero-dependency Kanban board (Python or Node.js backend, Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS frontend) for tracking work across MCD lifecycle columns (Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Review, Done), with milestone management, priorities, due dates, and filtering.
- **Command Deck — Dashboard** — Real-time project telemetry: active phase indicator, milestone burn-down progress bars, live blockers feed, one-click governance document rendering (charter, PRD, guardrails, active contract) with Mermaid diagram support, and a live git commit traceability feed (last 8 commits).
- **Command Deck — MCD Guide** — In-app fully rendered view of `MCD_PLAYBOOK.md`, with a "Why MCD?" modal explaining the core philosophy. Methodology documentation lives inside the tool.
- **Dual Server Runtime** — Command Deck runs on either Python 3 (stdlib only) or Node.js (stdlib only). Operator selects at scaffold time. Both expose an identical API surface. No external packages required at runtime.
- **Git Integration** — Automatic `git init` on new projects; branch-safety prompt (`mcd/init` branch option) on existing repositories. Scaffold commit and Charter/PRD commit follow the deterministic format: `chore(init): {CODENAME} scaffold - establish guardrails + command deck`.
- **Conflict Detection** — Before writing any files, the extension checks for existing `referenceDocs/` and `ops/launch-command-deck/` directories and surfaces a modal warning with Continue/Abort options. Scaffold is purely additive — no existing files are modified.
- **Persistent View State** — Command Deck remembers the last active view (Board, Dashboard, MCD Guide) via `localStorage`, rendered on first paint with zero visual flash.

## Success Metric

A solo operator with no prior MCD experience can go from an empty folder (or existing codebase) to a fully governed, operationally visible MCD project environment — with GUARDRAILS, Playbook, Kanban board, project dashboard, and initial git commit — **in under 60 seconds**, with zero external dependencies installed beyond a single chosen server runtime (Python 3 or Node.js).

Secondary metric: every contract executed under MCD governance produces zero rollbacks attributable to scope drift and zero uncontracted changes in the git history.

## MCD Milestone Structure

| Milestone | Focus |
|---|---|
| M1 | Evaluate + Scope |
| M2 | Contract + Plan |
| M3 | Build + Verify |
| M4 | Release Readiness |

---

## Constraints
- All features are subject to contract approval before implementation
- Architecture diagrams must use Mermaid.js syntax
- No cloud dependencies or runtime package managers
- Command Deck frontend: Vanilla JS / HTML / CSS only — no build tools, no frameworks
- TypeScript must compile with zero errors before any `.vsix` is packaged
