# Project Charter — AmphionAgent

Codename: `BlackClaw`
Version: `v0.01a`
Date: `202602211747`

## Overview
This document establishes the foundational intent, scope, and boundaries of the **AmphionAgent** project.

---

## Target Users

**Primary**: Solo operators — product managers, technical founders, designers, and domain experts — who build software with AI coding agents (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Codex) but who lack a formal governance layer to prevent scope drift, hallucination accumulation, and untraceable decision histories.

**Secondary**: Professional software engineers who adopt AI-assisted workflows and want deterministic, auditable development cycles with clean git histories and explicit scope boundaries for every delivered feature.

---

## Problem Statement

Solo operators building with AI agents move extraordinarily fast — but without structure, that speed becomes a liability. AI agents generate code in seconds, which means scope drifts at machine speed. Changes compound without authorization. There is no audit trail explaining why the system was built a particular way. When something breaks, there is no contract to reference, no checkpoint to roll back to, and no record of what was deliberately chosen versus improvised.

The result is fragile, undocumented software with no decision provenance — produced faster than any previous generation of tools, but just as ungovernable.

---

## Core Value Proposition

AmphionAgent operationalizes the **Micro-Contract Development (MCD) methodology** — a deterministic, contract-governed engineering framework that forces a deliberate pause before every code change, produces written authorization for every piece of work, and creates a traceable project history as a natural byproduct of the development process.

The core distinction: MCD's governance overhead is handled collaboratively between the operator and the AI agent. The agent drafts contracts and evaluation findings. The operator directs, refines, and authorizes. The constraint is on scope — not on craft. The result is that practitioners move fast *and* in the right direction, with zero rollbacks attributable to scope drift and zero defects attributable to uncontracted changes.

## Hard Non-Goals

- **No cloud services**: The Command Deck and all operational infrastructure run entirely on the local machine. No accounts, no subscriptions, no network calls to external services.
- **No package manager runtime dependencies**: The Command Deck backend (Python or Node.js) uses only the standard library at runtime. No `pip install`, no `npm install` required.
- **No enforcement beyond text-based contracts**: MCD does not programmatically block code changes. Governance is a discipline enforced by the operator and agent operating within the guardrails — not a technical lock-out system.
- **No multi-user or team workflows**: v0.01a targets the solo operator. Collaborative multi-user governance is explicitly out of scope for this version.
- **No modification of existing files on scaffold**: The MCD Starter Kit scaffold is purely additive. It does not overwrite or modify existing project files under any circumstance.

---

## Operating Constraints
- All development follows the MCD (Micro-Contract Development) methodology
- Every code change must be authorized by an active contract in `03_Contracts/active/`
- No contracted work begins without operator approval of the contract
- All versions are closed with a git commit using the format: `closeout: {VERSION} {description}`
- Architecture diagrams must use Mermaid.js syntax
- Document naming convention: `YYYYMMDDHHMM-DOCUMENT_TITLE.md`
