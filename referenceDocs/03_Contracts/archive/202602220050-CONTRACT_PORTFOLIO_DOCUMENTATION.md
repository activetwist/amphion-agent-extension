# Contract: CT-040 Portfolio-Grade Documentation Expansion (v1.20.0)

**Objective**: 
Transform the baseline pre-release build notes into a definitive, 360-degree technical record of AmphionAgent's development. This document serves as both a feature catalog and a case study in agentic engineering velocity.

**Context**: 
The project has evolved from v0.01 to v1.19.0 in an intense 3-day window. The user requires a portolio-quality accounting of "soup to nuts" capabilities and development metrics.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Documentation Expansion (`202602221229-Pre-Release-Build-Notes-AmphionAgent.md`)**:
   - Rewrite the file to include:
     - Full Features & Capabilities Matrix.
     - System Architecture Overview (VS Code Ext + WebUI).
     - Methodology Integration (MCD Lifecycle).
     - Agentic Velocity Analytics (Release timeline, contract volume, simulated dev hours).
     - Standards & Compliance (WCAG AA).

2. **Artifact Finalization**:
   - Ensure all links and technical terms are consistent with the "AmphionAgent" brand pivot.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Document is comprehensive (covers Scaffolding, UI, Themes, Persistence, and Branding).
- Includes an "Accounting of Effort" section with projected dev hours.
- Formatting is professional and suitable for portfolio presentation.
