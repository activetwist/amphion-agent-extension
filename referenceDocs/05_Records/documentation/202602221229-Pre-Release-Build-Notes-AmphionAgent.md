## 1. Executive Product Overview
**AmphionAgent** is a state-of-the-art methodology engine and developer companion designed for solo-operators workng at the frontier of AI-assisted software engineering. It implements the **Micro-Contract Development (MCD)** protocol—a deterministic framework that trades raw conversational speed for systemic reliability, zero-scope-creep, and total architectural observability.

What began as a simple "Starter Kit" has evolved into a comprehensive **Methodology OS** that governs the entire software lifecycle from onboarding to delivery.

## 2. Technical Feature Catalog (Soup to Nuts)

### 2.1 The Onboarding Engine (Precision Scaffolding)
- **Adaptive 5-Step Wizard**: A custom TypeScript-driven flow that captures:
  - Project Meta (Name, Codename).
  - Environment Config (Server Language, Port Mapping).
  - Version Control (Baseline Versioning).
- **Hybrid Scaffolder**: Generates a unified workspace combining a backend server (Node/Python) with a high-performance frontend "Command Deck."
- **Governance Bootstrapping**: Automatically deploys the MCD methodology directory structure (`00_Governance`, `03_Contracts`, `05_Records`).

### 2.2 The Command Deck (Methodology OS)
- **Unified Workspace UI**: A React-inspired, vanilla-JS powered dashboard centered on observability.
- **Kanban Card Engine**: Features deterministic issue numbering (e.g., `MCD-1`), priority badges (P0-P3), and drag-and-drop state transitions.
- **MCD Methodology Playbook**: A built-in, markdown-rendered documentation viewer (Guide) that provides real-time training for the operator.
- **Traceability Feed**: Live Git integration showing a semantic history of all code deployments.

### 2.3 Variable-First Theme Engine
- **Architectural Palettes**: Curated high-contrast themes including a rich Dark Mode and a high-performance Slate/Indigo Light Mode.
- **WCAG AA Compliance**: Every interactive element (buttons, badges, tabs) has been audited and refined to meet a 4.5:1 contrast ratio.
- **Zero-Flash Persistence**: Theme preferences are persisted in `localStorage` with a head-loading script to prevent unstyled content.

### 2.4 Persistence & Systemic Sync
- **State Serialization**: The complete methodology state (Boards, Cards, Milestones) is serialized to JSON and persisted via LocalStorage.
- **Cross-Process Sync**: Supports a bidirectional hot-reload loop between the VS Code extension and the Command Deck UI.

## 3. Agentic Velocity Analytics (Development Accounting)

The evolution of AmphionAgent reflects the transformative speed of agentic development. The project transitioned from a blank canvas to a production-grade extension in an intense **48-hour engineering burst**.

### 3.1 Velocity Metrics
| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Releases** | 38 (v0.01a to v1.20.0) |
| **Micro-Contracts Executed** | 40+ |
| **Calendar Time** | 2.5 Days |
| **Simulated Manual Effort** | **~80 Senior Engineering Hours** |
| **Efficiency Multiplier** | **~10x vs Manual Development** |

### 3.2 Key Milestones in the 48h Sprint
- **Hour 1-4**: Basic scaffold and VS Code extension boilerplate.
- **Hour 4-12**: Implementation of the 5-Step Wizard and Template Engine.
- **Hour 12-24**: Buildout of the Command Deck Web UI and Kanban Logic.
- **Hour 24-36**: Refactoring for Theme Support, Persistence, and Accessibility.
- **Hour 36-48**: Re-branding to AmphionAgent and final Portfolio-Grade documentation.

## 4. Engineering Standards & Methodology
AmphionAgent is its own first user. It was built using the very methodology it enforces:

- **Determinism**: No code was written without an explicit, timestamped contract.
- **Observability**: Every feature addition includes a corresponding EVAL findng, Contract, and Walkthrough.
- **Clean Architecture**: 
  - **TypeScript (Backend)**: Type-safe extension logic.
  - **Vanilla JavaScript/CSS (Frontend)**: Maximum performance with zero-runtime overhead.
  - **Modular Structure**: Separation of concerns between UI rendering, data management, and VS Code integration.

---

## 5. Deployment & Distribution
AmphionAgent is packaged as a canonical VS Code Extension (`.vsix`) containing all necessary assets to boot a local methodology server and dashboard instantly.
