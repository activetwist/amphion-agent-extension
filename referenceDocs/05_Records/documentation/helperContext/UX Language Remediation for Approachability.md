## **Evaluation: The "Jargon" Friction**

* **"Manual Strategy Definition":** This sounds like homework. It feels heavy and academic.  
* **"Core Value Proposition":** High-level business speak. Users usually think in terms of "What does this actually do?"  
* **"Hard Non-Goals":** A very disciplined PM term, but "Hard" can feel restrictive or negative to a creative user.  
* **"Success Metric":** Sounds like a KPI for a corporate review rather than a personal goal for a project.

**Remediation: Friendly & Actionable**

The goal here is to use **Micro-copy** that acts as a prompt, guiding the user to think about their project naturally.

| Current Label | Recommended Replacement | Why? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Manual Strategy Definition** | **Project Blueprint** | "Blueprint" implies building something tangible without the academic weight of "Strategy." |
| **Target Users** | **Who is this for?** | Framing it as a question makes it conversational and easier to answer. |
| **Problem Statement** | **What are you solving?** | Focuses on the "Pain Point" rather than the formal "Statement." |
| **Core Value Proposition** | **The Big Idea** | Simplifies the concept to the "elevator pitch" level. |
| **Hard Non-Goals** | **Out of Scope** (or "Not doing...") | "Out of Scope" is standard but softer; "What we aren't building" is even clearer. |
| **Success Metric** | **Definition of "Done"** | Focuses on the finish line rather than a statistical measurement. |

**Refined Placeholder Strategy**

Instead of generic technical examples, use "Mad Libs" style placeholders that show, don't tell.

* **Who is this for?:** *e.g., Freelance designers using AI for layout ideas*  
* **What are you solving?:** *e.g., It takes too long to format resumes manually*  
* **The Big Idea:** *e.g., A one-click tool that turns LinkedIn profiles into PDFs*  
* **Out of Scope:** *e.g., No mobile app; No custom fonts in v1*  
* **Definition of "Done":** *e.g., A user can export a finished resume in 60 seconds*

**UI Recommendation: The "Progressive Disclosure" Hint**

To avoid the wall of text, you can add a **small info icon (i)** next to labels like "The Big Idea" that reveals a single-sentence tooltip: *"Describe the one main benefit your project provides."*

Would you like me to rewrite the "Key Features" section to better align with this new, approachable tone?
