# CLOSEOUT RECORD: Extension Totality Portfolio Documentation Cycle

**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Codename:** `BlackClaw`  
**Version Alignment:** `v1.25.0` (documentation/governance cycle)  
**Executed At (UTC):** 2026-02-23T02:07:00Z

## 1. Closeout Scope
This closeout finalizes the executed documentation-focused contracts that produced:
- precise NotebookLM distillation velocity evidence,
- comprehensive extension totality portfolio documentation,
- and a validated Mermaid rendering test path with retained temporary test artifact.

## 2. Contracts Closed and Archived
The following executed contracts were moved from `referenceDocs/03_Contracts/active/` to `referenceDocs/03_Contracts/archive/`:
- `202602221937-CONTRACT_TEMP_MERMAID_ARCHITECTURE_TEST.md`
- `202602221944-CONTRACT_NOTEBOOKLM_VELOCITY_EVIDENCE_INSERT.md`
- `202602221955-CONTRACT_EXTENSION_TOTALITY_PORTFOLIO_RECORD.md`

## 3. Deliverables Produced
Primary artifacts completed in this cycle:
- `referenceDocs/02_Architecture/primitives/202602221955-AMPHIONAGENT_EXTENSION_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `referenceDocs/05_Records/documentation/202602221955-AMPHIONAGENT_EXTENSION_TOTALITY_RECORD.md`
- `referenceDocs/05_Records/documentation/202602221955-AMPHIONAGENT_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`
- `mcd-starter-kit-dev/docs/research/mcd-distillation.md`
- `referenceDocs/05_Records/documentation/helperContext/mcd-distillation-for-notebooklm.md`

Verification and walkthrough logs:
- `referenceDocs/05_Records/buildLogs/202602221937-EXECUTE_TEMP_MERMAID_ARCHITECTURE_TEST.md`
- `referenceDocs/05_Records/buildLogs/202602221937-WALKTHROUGH_TEMP_MERMAID_ARCHITECTURE_TEST.md`
- `referenceDocs/05_Records/buildLogs/202602221944-EXECUTE_NOTEBOOKLM_VELOCITY_EVIDENCE_INSERT.md`
- `referenceDocs/05_Records/buildLogs/202602221944-WALKTHROUGH_NOTEBOOKLM_VELOCITY_EVIDENCE_INSERT.md`
- `referenceDocs/05_Records/buildLogs/202602221955-EXECUTE_EXTENSION_TOTALITY_PORTFOLIO_RECORD.md`
- `referenceDocs/05_Records/buildLogs/202602221955-WALKTHROUGH_EXTENSION_TOTALITY_PORTFOLIO_RECORD.md`

## 4. Deterministic Evidence Captured
- NotebookLM helper-context now explicitly records measured active development time as:
  - `9h 50m 32s` (`9.8422 hours`, approximately `10 hours`)
- Method attribution remains anchored to:
  - `referenceDocs/04_Analysis/findings/202602221932-BUILD_GIT_TIME_ACCOUNTING_EVAL.md`

## 5. Governance Compliance Check
- [x] Executed contracts archived from active to archive.
- [x] Execute/walkthrough logs present for closed contracts.
- [x] Formal closeout record written in `05_Records/documentation/`.
- [x] Deterministic naming convention preserved (timestamp prefix).
- [x] Repository prepared for `closeout:` commit with scoped artifacts.

## 6. Active Contract State After Closeout
- Remaining active contract:
  - `referenceDocs/03_Contracts/active/202602230203-CONTRACT_CHARTS_TAB_AND_MERMAID_TEST_CLEANUP.md`
- Status: `Proposed` (not executed). It remains active intentionally and is not part of this closeout scope.

**Phase 4 (Closeout) Complete for the above executed contract set.**
