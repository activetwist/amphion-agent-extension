# EXECUTE LOG: Extension Totality Portfolio Record

**Contract:** `202602221955-CONTRACT_EXTENSION_TOTALITY_PORTFOLIO_RECORD.md`  
**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Executed At (UTC):** 2026-02-23T02:00:00Z  
**Codename:** `BlackClaw`

## Implementation Completed
1. Created extension architecture primitive:
   - `referenceDocs/02_Architecture/primitives/202602221955-AMPHIONAGENT_EXTENSION_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Includes Mermaid diagrams for topology, scaffold pipeline, Command Deck service architecture, and governance lifecycle.
2. Created comprehensive master portfolio record:
   - `referenceDocs/05_Records/documentation/202602221955-AMPHIONAGENT_EXTENSION_TOTALITY_RECORD.md`
   - Covers full scope: capabilities, pivots, development process, measurable outcomes, and MCD success framing.
3. Created source-backed evidence index:
   - `referenceDocs/05_Records/documentation/202602221955-AMPHIONAGENT_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`
   - Maps major claims to implementation files, contracts, findings, build logs, closeout records, and git history.

## Verification Evidence
- Confirmed all three target artifacts exist at expected paths.
- Confirmed architecture primitive contains Mermaid blocks.
- Confirmed totality record includes:
  - pivot chronology section
  - capability catalog section
  - deterministic metrics section with `9h 50m 32s (9.8422h)`
- Confirmed evidence index contains claim mapping tables and explicit references to source artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria Status
- [x] A comprehensive master record exists at `202602221955-AMPHIONAGENT_EXTENSION_TOTALITY_RECORD.md`.
- [x] The record explicitly documents major pivots and what each pivot changed.
- [x] A complete capability map exists and links capabilities to implementation files/evidence.
- [x] Architecture primitive exists with Mermaid diagrams and clear system boundaries.
- [x] Evidence index exists and maps major claims to verifiable artifacts.
- [x] Metrics section includes deterministic `9h 50m 32s (9.8422h)` active-time evidence with method attribution.
- [x] Execute and walkthrough records are created.

## Notes
- This execute slice is documentation and architecture-record creation only; no extension runtime behavior was modified.
