# WALKTHROUGH: Extension Totality Portfolio Record

## Goal
Validate that AmphionAgent now has a complete, portfolio-grade, source-backed totality record covering what was built, how it evolved, and why the outcome demonstrates MCD success.

## Steps
1. Open architecture primitive:
   - `referenceDocs/02_Architecture/primitives/202602221955-AMPHIONAGENT_EXTENSION_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Verify Mermaid sections exist for:
   - runtime topology
   - scaffold generation pipeline
   - Command Deck service architecture
   - governance artifact lifecycle
3. Open master record:
   - `referenceDocs/05_Records/documentation/202602221955-AMPHIONAGENT_EXTENSION_TOTALITY_RECORD.md`
4. Verify the master record includes:
   - comprehensive capability catalog
   - pivot chronology table
   - development/process narrative
   - deterministic metrics including `9h 50m 32s (9.8422h)`
5. Open evidence index:
   - `referenceDocs/05_Records/documentation/202602221955-AMPHIONAGENT_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`
6. Verify claim-to-artifact mapping coverage for:
   - product identity and packaging
   - runtime/scaffold capabilities
   - command deck API and UI features
   - pivot and closeout evidence
   - measured development metrics

## Expected Results
- Portfolio consumer can read one master document and validate every major claim via evidence index references.
- Architecture is represented in Mermaid and anchored to concrete implementation files.
- Pivots are explicitly represented as intentional evolution, not undocumented drift.

## Rollback (if needed)
- Remove the three generated documentation artifacts.
- Re-run execute with tightened section scope and revised evidence mapping.
