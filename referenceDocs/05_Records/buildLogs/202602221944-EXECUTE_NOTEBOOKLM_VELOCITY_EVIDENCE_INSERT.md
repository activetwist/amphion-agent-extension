# EXECUTE LOG: NotebookLLM Velocity Evidence Insert

**Contract:** `202602221944-CONTRACT_NOTEBOOKLM_VELOCITY_EVIDENCE_INSERT.md`  
**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Executed At (UTC):** 2026-02-23T01:46:06Z  
**Codename:** `BlackClaw`

## Implementation Completed
1. Added a new velocity evidence bullet to the distillation evidence section in:
   - `mcd-starter-kit-dev/docs/research/mcd-distillation.md`
2. Synchronized NotebookLLM helper-context copy:
   - `referenceDocs/05_Records/documentation/helperContext/mcd-distillation-for-notebooklm.md`
3. Inserted statement includes:
   - Precise active development time: `9h 50m 32s (9.8422 hours)`
   - Practical framing: approximately 10 hours
   - Method reference: deterministic git-sessionized accounting
   - Source findings artifact: `202602221932-BUILD_GIT_TIME_ACCOUNTING_EVAL.md`

## Verification Evidence
- Source distillation contains required velocity evidence markers:
  - `9h 50m 32s`
  - `9.8422 hours`
  - `approximately 10 hours`
  - `git-sessionized accounting`
  - `202602221932-BUILD_GIT_TIME_ACCOUNTING_EVAL.md`
- Source/helper distillation parity check succeeded (`cmp` status 0).

## Acceptance Criteria Status
- [x] Distillation evidence section includes novice-operator velocity datapoint with precise value `9h 50m 32s (9.8422 hours)`.
- [x] Distillation text communicates practical framing as approximately 10 hours.
- [x] Statement references logged git/build evaluation methodology.
- [x] Source and helper-context distillation files are synchronized after update.
- [x] Execute and walkthrough build-log records are created.

## Notes
- This execution was documentation-only and did not alter extension runtime/scaffolder behavior.
