This project uses the **Micro-Contract Development (MCD)** protocol.

Before starting any task, verify the active development phase and read the corresponding command file:
- Phase 1: `referenceDocs/00_Governance/mcd/EVALUATE.md`
- Phase 2: `referenceDocs/00_Governance/mcd/CONTRACT.md`
- Phase 3: `referenceDocs/00_Governance/mcd/EXECUTE.md`
- Phase 4: `referenceDocs/00_Governance/mcd/CLOSEOUT.md`

Maintain systemic determinism by following the step-by-step instructions in these files. Do not modify files not listed in the 'Approved AFPs' of an active contract.
