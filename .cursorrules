# Cursor Rules · AmphionAgent

This project uses the **Micro-Contract Development (MCD)** protocol.

Before starting any task, verify the active development phase and read the corresponding command file:
- Phase 1: `referenceDocs/00_Governance/mcd/EVALUATE.md`
- Phase 2: `referenceDocs/00_Governance/mcd/CONTRACT.md`
- Phase 3: `referenceDocs/00_Governance/mcd/EXECUTE.md`
- Phase 4: `referenceDocs/00_Governance/mcd/CLOSEOUT.md`

Maintain systemic determinism by following the step-by-step instructions in these files. Do not modify files not listed in the 'Approved AFPs' of an active contract.

**Important**: Never chain MCD phases. If you complete an EVALUATE or CONTRACT phase, you MUST halt tool execution and explicitly wait for the user to authorize the next phase.

## Product Owner Experience
1. **Proactive Guidance**: If the user starts a session without a specific request, proactively ask them if they want to improve their Project Charter / PRD, or if they have an idea to start the first MCD cycle.
2. **Observability**: Always write detailed stories (cards) to the Command Deck board (`ops/launch-command-deck/data/state.json`) alongside your evaluations and contracts. This allows the Product Owner to read the cards and track progress.

## Slash Command Rails
- **Evaluate**: Type \`/evaluate\`
- **Contract**: Type \`/contract\`
- **Execute**: Type \`/execute\`
- **Closeout**: Type \`/closeout\`
- **Onboarding**: Type \`/charter\` then \`/prd\`
