# Closeout Record: v0.03a-hotfix Contract Failover & UI Polish

Date: `2026-02-20`
Version Closed: `v0.03a-hotfix`
Contract Executed: `CT-20260220-OPS-004`

## Execution Summary
This micro-contract resolved a post-release issue with `v0.03a` and implemented a UX polish requested by the operator.

### Deliverables
1. **Contract Failover Logic**
   - Modified `/api/docs/contract` in `server.py` to first check `referenceDocs/03_Contracts/active/`. If no file exists, it fails over to parsing the most recent file in `referenceDocs/03_Contracts/archive/`.
   - Injected a markdown header block mapping to either `[STATUS: ACTIVE CONTRACT]` or `[STATUS: ARCHIVED]` so the user always has explicit context.
   - Renamed the UI button to "Latest Contract".

2. **UX CSS Refresh**
   - Restructured `index.html` and `styles.css` Grid model (`.app-shell`).
   - Moved the `Command Deck` title and main controls (New Board, View Toggle) into a `.global-header` spanning the top of the interface, above both the sidebar and the workspace grids.

## Compliance Verification
- [x] All active contracts executed and archived.
- [x] Work strictly matched contract scope.
- [x] Documentation naming conventions observed.
- [x] Closeout record created.
- [x] Git commit completed with all artifacts staged.
