# Closeout Record: v0.04a-ui-hotfix Global Border Radius

Date: `2026-02-20`
Version Closed: `v0.04a-ui-hotfix`
Contract Executed: `CT-20260220-OPS-006`

## Execution Summary
This micro-contract executed a sweeping aesthetic update to hard-enforce a localized `4px` border radius across the Command Deck interface. 

### Deliverables
1. **Global CSS Variable Update**
   - Redefined `--radius` under the `:root` pseudo-class to equal `4px` rather than the default `14px` within `styles.css`.
2. **Variable Inheritance Injection**
   - Transmuted 16 scattered hard-coded `border-radius: [value]px;` assignments to identically inherit the `var(--radius)` property.
   - Result: All components—dialog boxes, input fields, navigation tabs, milestone modules, kanban columns, and utility buttons—dynamically snap to exactly `4px` conforming to the operator's aesthetic directives.
