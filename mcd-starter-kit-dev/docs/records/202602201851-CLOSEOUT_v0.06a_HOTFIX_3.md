# Closeout Record: v0.06a-hotfix-3 Sidebar Sync Optimization

Date: `2026-02-20`
Version Closed: `v0.06a-hotfix-3`
Contract Executed: `CT-20260220-OPS-011`

## Execution Summary
Resolved an initialization defect where booting the SPA directly into the Dashboard or MCD Guide via `localStorage` bypassed the Javascript function required to render the global "Milestone Progress" sidebar metrics.

### Deliverables
1. **Architectural Decoupling**
   - Discovered that `renderMilestoneProgress()` was nested inside an `else` condition within `app.js`, strictly executing only when the Kanban `boardView` was active.
   - Decoupled the rendering call, elevating it into the unconditional section of the `render()` loop alongside `renderBoardList()`.
   - The `<aside class="sidebar">` now receives its telemetry payloads identically across all 3 workspace tabs automatically.

## Compliance Verification
- [x] All active contracts executed and archived.
- [x] Work strictly matched contract scope.
- [x] Documentation naming conventions observed.
- [x] Closeout record created.
