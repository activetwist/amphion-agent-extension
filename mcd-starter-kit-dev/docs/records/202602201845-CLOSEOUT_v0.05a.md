Date: `2026-02-20`
Version Closed: `v0.05a`
Contract Executed: `CT-20260220-OPS-007`

## Execution Summary
This build added a strategic contextual explainer into the Command Deck UI, justifying the underlying Micro-Contract methodology to operators.

### Deliverables
1. **'Why MCD' Action Element**
   - Injected `<button id="btnWhyMcd">` into the `guideView` header in `index.html`.
2. **Contextual Dialog Modal**
   - Crafted a native HTML `<dialog id="whyMcdDialog">` populated with semantic editorial copy covering the three operational pillars: Constraint is Freedom, Total Observability, and Deterministic Engineering.
3. **Event Routing**
   - Bound opening (`showModal()`) and closing (`close()`) click listener events to the button and dialog form inside `app.js`.
