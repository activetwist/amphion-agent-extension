# Closeout Record: v0.06a-hotfix-2 Tab Switch Bug Fix

Date: `2026-02-20`
Version Closed: `v0.06a-hotfix-2`
Contract Executed: `CT-20260220-OPS-010`

## Execution Summary
Resolved a routing defect introduced by the `v0.06a-hotfix` where navigating between SPA tabs (e.g. Dashboard to Board) resulted in a blank screen until the browser was hard refreshed. 

### Deliverables
1. **DOM Attribute State Syncing**
   - Discovered that the root CSS `data-current-view` attribute—used to prevent FOUC on reload—was never updated by Javascript when a user clicked a `.navTab` element.
   - Inserted `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-current-view', state.currentView);` into the main `registerEvents()` listener in `app.js`.
   - By explicitly instructing the Javascript engine to update the root CSS driver along with its own internal state, the Command Deck now fluidly switches tabs without interference from the FOUC prevention styles.
