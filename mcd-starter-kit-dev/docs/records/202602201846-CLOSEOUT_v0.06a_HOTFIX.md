# Closeout Record: v0.06a-hotfix View Flash Elimination

Date: `2026-02-20`
Version Closed: `v0.06a-hotfix`
Contract Executed: `CT-20260220-OPS-009`

## Execution Summary
Resolved an issue where refreshing the browser on a non-default tab (Dashboard or Guide) resulted in a "Flash of Unstyled Content" (FOUC), temporarily displaying the Kanban board before correcting itself.

### Deliverables
1. **Synchronous Render Blocking**
   - Injected a blocking `<script>` and `<style>` node into the `<head>` of `index.html`.
   - The script natively reads `localStorage` before the `<body>` can be parsed by the browser.
2. **First-Frame Painting**
   - Evaluated the cached view and bound it to the `data-current-view` attribute on the root `<html>` node.
   - Forced `display: none !important;` on all inactive tabs by leveraging CSS attribute selectors, ensuring the browser engine natively hides the wrong views during the initial `<head>` parsing phase.
