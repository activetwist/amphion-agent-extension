# Closeout Record: v0.03a Command Deck Observability

Date: `2026-02-20`
Version Closed: `v0.03a`
Contract Executed: `CT-20260220-OPS-003`

## Execution Summary
The `v0.03a` build iteration successfully introduced a General Observability Dashboard to the Command Deck and formally codified `Mermaid.js` diagramming requirements.

### Deliverables
1. **Governance & Scaffold Update**
   - Added Documentation Standards to `GUARDRAILS.md` and `MCD_SCAFFOLD_v2.md`, mandating `Mermaid.js` syntax for systemic architecture diagrams.
2. **Project Type Configuration**
   - `init_command_deck.py` now accepts `--type` upon instantiation and injects `projectType` into the initial Kanban state payload.
3. **Observability Backend**
   - Added `/api/docs/{doc_id}` to securely serve the `PROJECT_CHARTER.md`, `HIGH_LEVEL_PRD.md`, `GUARDRAILS.md`, and the active Contract.
   - Added `/api/git/log` to serve the trailing 8 commits.
4. **Dashboard Experience**
   - Implemented a dual-view architecture (Board vs. Dashboard) in `index.html` and `app.js`.
   - Included CDN references to `marked.js` and `mermaid.js` to render reference artifacts beautifully within a unified Modal Viewer window.
   - Built panels for Project Vitals (Phase inference, Milestone burn-down, Blocker alerts), the Core Reference Library, and Traceability (Git log).

## Compliance Verification
- [x] All active contracts executed and archived.
- [x] Work strictly matched contract scope.
- [x] Documentation naming conventions observed.
- [x] Closeout record created.
- [x] Git commit completed with all artifacts staged.

The project is now stable and features significantly elevated observability telemetry without violating the strict "local-only, zero dependency" constraint for the Python server tier.
