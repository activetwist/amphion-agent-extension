# Closeout Record: v0.06a View State Persistence

Date: `2026-02-20`
Version Closed: `v0.06a`
Contract Executed: `CT-20260220-OPS-008`

## Execution Summary
The Command Deck SPA was upgraded to cache and restore the operator's active tab view across hard browser refreshes, establishing a persistent contextual state using local device boundaries.

### Deliverables
1. **Frontend State Refactor**
   - Modified the `state` object declaration in `ops/launch-command-deck/public/app.js` to initialize the `currentView` property synchronously from `localStorage.getItem("mcd_current_view")`.
   - The system defaults safely to `"board"` on cold boots or null keys.
2. **Event Caching Injection**
   - Attached a `localStorage.setItem("mcd_current_view", ...)` action inside the `.navTabs` click event listener.
   - The methodology strictly honors the Local-Only mandate by utilizing native browser APIs rather than establishing a database or server dependency for UI preferences.
