# Closeout Record: v0.04a Tabbed UX & MCD Walkthrough

Date: `2026-02-20`
Version Closed: `v0.04a`
Contract Executed: `CT-20260220-OPS-005`

## Execution Summary
This build cycle executed a structural UX overhaul for the Command Deck navigation system and formally integrated an in-app walkthrough of the Micro-Contract Development (MCD) methodology.

### Deliverables
1. **MCD Playbook & Scaffold Injection**
   - Created `referenceDocs/00_Governance/MCD_PLAYBOOK.md` covering the 4-phase lifecycle and rules of engagement.
   - Modified `MCD_SCAFFOLD_v2.md` to automatically generate this Playbook document for all future deck bootstraps.
2. **Backend Playbook Server**
   - Added `/api/docs/playbook` endpoint to `server.py` to securely serve the document payload to the frontend router.
3. **Tabbed Navigation Paradigm**
   - Replaced the single binary View Toggle button with a global `.nav-tabs` array (`[Board] [Dashboard] [MCD Guide]`).
   - Floated the `New Board` action button to the far right, explicitly severing it from navigation logic.
   - Deployed the `guideView` main container to render the Playbook via `marked.js`.
   - Updated `state.currentView` in `app.js` to handle tripartite state routing.
